<h1>ControlGetFocus</h1>

<p>Retrieves which control of the target window has keyboard focus, if any.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ControlGetFocus</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the output variable in which to store the control's <a href="../misc/ControlID.htm#ClassNN">ClassNN</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If each of these is blank or omitted, the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</a> will be used. Otherwise, specify for <em>WinTitle</em> a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">window title or other criteria</a> to identify the target window and/or for <em>WinText</em> a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included <a href="../Program.htm#Window_Spy">Window Spy</a> utility).</p>
    <p><em>ExcludeTitle</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em> can be used to exclude one or more windows by their title or text. Their specification is similar to <em>WinTitle</em> and <em>WinText</em>, except that <em>ExcludeTitle</em> does not recognize any criteria other than the window title.</p>
    <p>Window titles and text are case-sensitive. By default, hidden windows are not detected and hidden text elements are detected, unless changed with <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a>. By default, a window title must start with the specified <em>WinTitle</em> or <em>ExcludeTitle</em> to be a match, unless changed with <a href="SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the control with keyboard focus was successfully retrieved. Otherwise (e.g. the target window doesn't exist or none of its controls have keyboard focus) it will be set to 1.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This command is intended for use with controls in a non-GUI window, i.e. a window that is not created with the <a href="Gui.htm">Gui</a> command. It works best with common or predefined Microsoft controls; some applications use custom or modified controls, in which case the command might not work as expected. For <a href="GuiControls.htm">GUI controls</a>, it is usually more convenient to use <a href="GuiControlGet.htm#Focus">GuiControlGet Focus</a> or in <span class="ver">[v1.0.43.06+]</span> <a href="GuiControlGet.htm#FocusV">GuiControlGet FocusV</a>.</p>
<p>The control retrieved by this command is the one that has keyboard focus, that is, the one that would receive keystrokes if the user were to type any.</p>
<p>The target window must be active to have a focused control. If the window is not active, <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank.</p>
<p>Prior to <span class="ver">[v1.1.19.03]</span>, if ControlGetFocus was executed repeatedly at a high frequency (i.e. every 500&nbsp;ms or faster), it usually disrupted the user's ability to double-click. This has been fixed.</p>
